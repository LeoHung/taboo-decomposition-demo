This project is for generating demo pages of taboo-decomposition on airlines data.
It requires the cluster result as "airport_id,airport_id,airline_id" format. The
ids are assumed hashed, and it also requires a mapping file. Given airport data
file, conversion mapping file, and cluster files, gen_js.py generates the output
javascript file to store the locations of the airports. And then, gen_page.py
can generate demo html files based on the javascript files.

Sample usage:

python gen_js.py airports.dat conv_airports out.0/part* > out/out.0.js
python gen_js.py airports.dat conv_airports out.1/part* > out/out.1.js
python gen_js.py airports.dat conv_airports out.2/part* > out/out.2.js
python gen_js.py airports.dat conv_airports out.3/part* > out/out.3.js

python gen_page.py out/ AIzaSyD3xACEruO96pXttoYtYtNKn52E2-K4zE0
